# flags_and_religion

<h2>About</h2>
For this project, we used machine learning to 
explore the potential predicitability of a country's religion based on the design of their flag. We then summarized our project and outcomes on <a href="https://zpoeschl.github.io/flags_and_religion/">this website</a> which we encourage you to explore.
<br>
<br>
We used the <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags" target="_blank">
flags data set</a> available through the <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml" target="_blank">
UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. This data set is not large, consisting
of only 194 instances (countries/flags) and 30 attributes (descriptors), making
the size of our experiments simultaneously manageable and limited.
<br>
<br>
To explore this data set and apply machine learning, we performed tests using a jupyter notebook. 
Within our notebook we used scikit-learn to test a neural network, the most successful of our tests, as well as 
a support-vector machine. Pandas and Matplotlib were also used to support the processing and visualization of 
our data.
