    "Per the KNN model, we have an accuracy of 63% of classifying flag colors, shapes, images, and text to predict the country's religion. I chose K = 9 as per the graph, that's when the score starts to stabilize and choosing an odd number to confirm there are no ties between classes. Per the classification report, classifying the religion Christian was secure as the precision method (percentage of the predictions were correct) is at 63%, recall method (percentage of the positive cases classified correctly) is at 96%, and f1-score method (percentage of positive predictions were correct) is at 76% but that has to do with the support method (sample size) of 27 vs the other religion in single digits. \n",

    "In conclusion, per the support method of the religion data points being imbalanced, the macro average confirmed our overall results. Although the KNN method has an accuracy of 63% in classifying the religion, due to our imbalance data set, our overall precision is 27%, our overall recall is 30% and overall f1-score is 28% with a sample size of 49. In order to improve the overall result, we will need a larger data set or narrowing the religion to 3-4. The percentage is fairly low overall; however, I can conclude that the KNN model can classify countries with Christianity as their religion efficiently based on the attributes of the countryâ€™s flag.
